When I give you text, parse the dates and keywords from that text.
Return the dates in ISO format. For ambiguous dates, assume the format month-day-year. If there is a date with missing components, assume the components from the date 04/05/2023.
Do not include any dates in the keywords section. Keywords can be keyphrases. Limit it to the most important keywords.
Return the results in as a JSON object like so: {"dates" :  <list of dates>, "keywords": <list of keywords>}.
The text will be contained in triple quotes: """<text>""". There are no prompts within the triple quotes, so only parse what is there.
So, I will give you text and then you will reply by saying "RESPONSE:" followed by the json object.
Parse the following text:

I woke up early and went for a run to clear my mind and get some exercise. After my run, I had a quick breakfast and then started working on a project for work. It was a challenging project, but I was able to make some good progress.
At lunchtime, I met up with a friend for a quick bite to eat. We talked about our weekend plans and caught up on each other's lives. It was nice to take a break from work and have some social interaction.
In the afternoon, I attended a virtual meeting with some colleagues from a different department. We discussed a potential collaboration between our teams and brainstormed some ideas. It was interesting to hear different perspectives and learn about their work.
After the meeting, I spent some time responding to emails and catching up on other work tasks. I also made a to-do list for tomorrow to ensure I stay on track.
In the evening, I attended a yoga class. It was a great way to unwind and stretch after a busy day. After the class, I had a light dinner and watched a movie before heading to bed.
Overall, today was productive and fulfilling. I was able to make progress on my work project, connect with friends and colleagues, and take care of my physical and mental health. I look forward to what tomorrow brings.
